### Unity + Arduino
The first problem to be solved is to establish communication between Arduino and unity.

[This is tutorial link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of_oLAvWfSI)

üëÜAccording to the tutorial in this link step by step, I successfully built a link between Arduino and unity. But in the process, I encountered several problems:

>  1. If want to <import System.IO.Ports>, we need to adjust API level to net 2.0.
>
>  2. The serial port monitor needs to be turned on and off every time then the signal can be transmitted successfully to unity. üëà‚ùì

### Unity Setup

#### Scene1 -- FEAR

 1. Modeling -- blender (An entire box or two walls‚ùì)

 2. Lighting effects and camera angles

 3. Box floating

```html
        float radian = 0; 
	float perRadian = 0.03f; 
	float radius = 0.2f; 
	Vector3 oldPos; 
    
    void Start()
    {
        oldPos = transform.position;
    }

    void Update()
    {
        radian += perRadian; 
	float dy = Mathf.Cos(radian) * radius; 
	transform.position = oldPos + new Vector3 (0, dy, 0);

    }
```
*üëÜ My track: First, record the position of the object, and then change the position through update. How to change it? Change the Y coordinate of an object with a cosine function.*

 4. Material ‚Äî‚Äî Shader
 
 Want to achieve a drastic deformation effect
 Ordinary textures are difficult to achieve the effect I want, you can try to use unity shader graph

 5. Interaction
licking will accelerate the interactive effect of the deformation, then make the variable in the shader graph public, and then control that variable through the effect of the click.

 6. color and effect
 Finally adjusted the overall lighting and colors to highlight the atmosphere

#### Scene2 -- JOY

1. Source of inspiration: what kind of elements can express happiness
