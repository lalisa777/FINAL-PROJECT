The first problem to be solved is to establish communication between Arduino and unity.

ðŸ‘†According to the tutorial in this link step by step, I successfully built a link between Arduino and unity. But in the process, I encountered several problems:

> 1.If want to <import System.IO.Ports>, we need to adjust API level to net 2.0.
 
  2.The serial port monitor needs to be turned on and off every time then the signal can be transmitted successfully to unity. ðŸ‘ˆ WHYï¼Ÿ
