The first problem to be solved is to establish communication between Arduino and unity.

[This is tutorial link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of_oLAvWfSI)

👆According to the tutorial in this link step by step, I successfully built a link between Arduino and unity. But in the process, I encountered several problems:

>  1. If want to <import System.IO.Ports>, we need to adjust API level to net 2.0.
>
>  2. The serial port monitor needs to be turned on and off every time then the signal can be transmitted successfully to unity. 👈❓

### Unity Setup
Setup the virtual world -- UI reference

#### Scene1 -- FEAR

> 1. Modeling -- blender (An entire box or two walls❓)

> 2. Lighting effects and camera angles

> 3. Box floating
