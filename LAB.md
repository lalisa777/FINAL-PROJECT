### Unity + Arduino
The first problem to be solved is to establish communication between Arduino and unity.

[This is tutorial link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of_oLAvWfSI)

üëÜAccording to the tutorial in this link step by step, I successfully built a link between Arduino and unity. But in the process, I encountered several problems:

>  1. If want to <import System.IO.Ports>, we need to adjust API level to net 2.0.
>
>  2. The serial port monitor needs to be turned on and off every time then the signal can be transmitted successfully to unity. üëà‚ùì

#### Scene1 -- FEAR

 1. Modeling -- blender (An entire box or two walls‚ùì)

 2. Lighting effects and camera angles

 3. Box floating

```html
        float radian = 0; 
	float perRadian = 0.03f; 
	float radius = 0.2f; 
	Vector3 oldPos; 
    
    void Start()
    {
        oldPos = transform.position;
    }

    void Update()
    {
        radian += perRadian; 
	float dy = Mathf.Cos(radian) * radius; 
	transform.position = oldPos + new Vector3 (0, dy, 0);

    }
```
*üëÜ My track: First, record the position of the object, and then change the position through update. How to change it? Change the Y coordinate of an object with a cosine function.*

 4. Material ‚Äî‚Äî Shader
 
 Want to achieve a drastic deformation effect
 Ordinary textures are difficult to achieve the effect I want, you can try to use unity shader graph
 [This is tutorial link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr_tdKCT2Xs)
 
 5. Interaction
licking will accelerate the interactive effect of the deformation, then make the variable in the shader graph public, and then control that variable through the effect of the click.

 6. color and effect
 Finally adjusted the overall lighting and colors to highlight the atmosphere

#### Scene2 -- JOY

1. Source of inspiration: what kind of elements can express happiness

  keywords : full, round, soft, clear
  
  2. Jumping balls
  
  Use a small jumping ball to represent the factor of happiness. When jumping on the screen, it is best to use a soft material, which will deform when it is squeezed by collision.
  
  ‚ùì How to make the balls fall all in an instant?
I can add a baffle above, if you click it, the baffle disappears and the ball will fall

‚ùóÔ∏è Doing so will greatly slow down the running speed of the game, which may be because a lot of models need to be pre-loaded at the beginning of the game (especially these models require a lot of vector operations in order to achieve soft materials)
üëÜhow to solve this problemÔºüÔºü

‚ú® prefab!!


‚ùì soft material
Still use shader graph to complete

3. color

‚ú®Is there a need for a color change? After the interaction, the color flashes, which is a happy effectÔºü

 #### conclusion
 
 This piece is based on Donald Arthur Norman‚Äôs theory ‚Äì ‚Äòemotional design‚Äô to create emotions in an virtual environment. Analyze and study the three levels of visceral, behavioral and reflectional respectively, and try to involve players‚Äô internal experience into the design of scenes and interactions in scenes in order to stimulate and evoke players‚Äô emotional experience. 

The following is an analysis of the three emotions mentioned above (joy, sadness, fear) based on the three levels of emotional design for game design.

-	Visceral Level
At the visceral level, the factors that affect emotion and behavior are people's reactions to the visual objects in the game. For this game, two branches of psychology are emphatically described here, which study the effects of shape and color on people's visual perception. In short, each color and shape tends to be perceived with its meaning, so when players view a visual object, the brain will receive a certain message and reacts according to what they see.

Color is a very significant factor in design. The research provided by Colorcom showed that people could make subconscious judgments about products in only 90 seconds, and 62% to 90% of evaluations are based on color only. The shape is also a reasonable basis for analyzing all visual objects. People may not always notice what figures and shapes surround them still they have a significant impact on their consciousness and behavior. 

Pic 5: Visual effects of three scenes
For the emotion of joy, orange and green are used in the choice of colors, which represent the sunlight and life. The shape is spherical because this kind of curve means softness and relaxation, which gives people a feeling of fullness and strength in emotion. Blue is selected for the emotion of sadness. In the scene, there are various, but regular straight lines to create a sense of balance, stability, and continuity. The emotion of fear is expressed in two contrasting colors, which are red and green. Red makes people feel dangerous. It is outstanding against the contrast of green. The background uses repeated cubes to create a sense of loss, and some irregular and angular geometric figures are in the front to give people a sense of danger.

-	Behavioral Level
The behavioral level is aimed at the interaction design in the game, and emotions are expressed through the flow of interaction. The way of interaction during the game and the feedback that the game gives to the player affect the player's feeling.

For the emotion of joy, the entire interaction flow describes that the feeling of joy is relaxed and pleasant, and joy is hugely influential. Therefore, the overall speed of interaction is brisk. Clicking on the surrounding balls can trigger the balls to fly quickly, giving the players instant and intense feedback and creating a positive emotion. At the same time, the small flying ball may hit the big ball, causing the big ball to spin quickly, which is to express that everyone is easily infected by happy emotion.

Sadness and joy are opposite interaction flows. The overall rhythm is slow. The way of interaction is slower dragging instead of fast clicking. Dragging the lines makes the lines rotate slowly, showing different light and shadow effects.

The generation of fear is always accompanied by unknown and unfamiliar. Therefore, in the flow, the feedback after the interaction must give the player a sense of unknown. The changes between the screens cannot be continuous, which provides an uncomfortable feeling to players. In this scene, the player can cause intense deformation of geometric objects by clicking. The speed of deformation will increase as the number of clicks increases until the object explodes.
